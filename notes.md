# Kernels
what are kernels?
well its a piece of code that interacts directly with hardware it acts as bridge between user inteface and hardware via an operating system <br>
kernels are of many types, but the duo that is popular is monolithic and micro kernel<br>
all device driver and file management system occurs in single piece of code whereas in micro kernel the kernel program is small but all the device driver and user application considerd as user level program 
or another words kernel coordinates them doing stuff 

linux is monolithic 
how to make kernel?
